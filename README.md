Our America

My game is a history trivia game modeled on the board game, Our America. It focuses on many of the topics we have discussed in history class this year. I decided to make a digital version of Our America because I thought it would help me study for history. Whether you are looking to have fun, learn something, or to see how much you know about American History this game has something for you!
